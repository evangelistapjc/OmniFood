# OmniFood

This is a website creation featuring a fake company called "Omnifood", a food delivery subscription service, which was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery. An important component of this website is that it is completely responsive to the viewpage size of your browser, whether it be a fullscreen window or being viewed on your phone, the website will adapt to that specific screen size.

## Acknowledgements

I was able to produce this website in coordination with an extensive HTML and CSS course on Udemy taught by Jonas Schmedtmann using many modern HTML, Javascript, and CSS practices.
